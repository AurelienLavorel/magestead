#### Introduction
While there is no perfect vagrant box setup that will fit the needs of everyone, there are many out there that do the job brilliantly. Inspired by the amazing [Laravel Homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/homestead "Laravel Homestead") & [ScotchBox](https://box.scotch.io/ "ScotchBox"), Magestead will fit the needs of most Magento developers who may also work in multiple different frameworks and donâ€™t want the hassle of switching boxes.

Magestead is designed to be configurable like Homestead using the YAML configuration while maintaining a much easier per project workflow that ScotchBox offers. The most obvious change in Magestead is the switch from an Ubuntu box to a CentOS box. This switch is to accommodate the developers who work in a Red Hat/CentOS environment everyday and prefer the package managers and comfort of a system they know.

#### What's in the box?
With a CentOS 6.6 core server using NGINX, PHP 5.6, MySQL 5.6, Redis & Memcached, you know you have a development environment with performance!
